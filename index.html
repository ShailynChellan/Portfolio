	 <h2>About Me</h2>
	  <p>My name is <strong>Shailyn Chellan</strong>, Iâ€™m 22 years old, and Iâ€™m an aspiring software developer with a deep-rooted passion for technology. My interest in this field began as early as primary school, where I found myself captivated by the idea that just a few lines of code could produce something entirely functionalâ€”and often beautifulâ€”on a screen. That early fascination led me down a path of curiosity and exploration. In Grade 7, I started researching on my own, tinkering with old hardware around the house, watching tutorials on YouTube, and even experimenting with developer modes and source code on outdated tabletsâ€”sometimes breaking them in the process, but always learning something new.</p>
      <p>Now, over a decade later, that same passion drives me every day. As Iâ€™ve progressed through both high school and college, Iâ€™ve continued to expand my understanding of information technology, from learning new programming languages and frameworks to building full-fledged projects both in and outside of the classroom. One of the things I love most about this field is that itâ€™s ever-evolving; thereâ€™s always something new to learn, a better way to build, and opportunities to grow. Whether itâ€™s staying up late trying to solve a bug, exploring a new tool I havenâ€™t used before, or reading up on the latest tech trends, I find real joy in the learning process.</p>
	  <p>I consider myself a hardworking, passionate, and goal-driven individual. Throughout my time in college, Iâ€™ve consistently pushed myself to do more, not just to pass, but to truly understand and improve. Iâ€™ve tackled challenging assignments and projects with enthusiasm, often going beyond the requirements to explore additional features or techniques that could enhance my learning.</p>
	  <p>I take pride in being a lifelong learner. I'm always seeking out new skills, whether it's a programming language I haven't touched yet, a development environment I haven't worked in, or even a completely new area like UI/UX or machine learning. I firmly believe that every challenge is a chance to grow, and that mindset has helped shape me into the developer I am todayâ€”and the one Iâ€™m striving to become.</p>
